[World computing on a decentralized Platform] (https://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-devs-depart-gorlick-dilley-world-computer/)

Cloud computing has become a new marketing buzzword at every corner. Google phones now with unlimited cloud storage, Amazon cloud storage and computation, and so and so forth. Yet, with the advent of blockchain technologies and platforms, cloud computing may already be outdated. Platforms such as Ethereum and Cardano which feature smart contract layers promise to offer more computational power, privacy, and trust (or lack of trust if you will) than any centralized provider could ever offer. With many nodes in the network contributing to the computational process, smart contracts promise to allow people to take full control of their software and data, all while providing a service in network computation. Overall, I believe soon we will begin to see major cloud services providers begin to swithc over to blockchain, or risk getting left behind.
